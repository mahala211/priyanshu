# Game Theory: Auction-Based Games and Behavioral Analysis

## Overview
This project explores the application of game theory and auction theory in designing and analyzing strategic games. It focuses on two auction-based games: *Highest Unique Bid Auction* and *Dutch Auction*, providing insights into their mechanics, strategies, and behavioral dynamics. The study includes theoretical modeling, assumptions, comparisons, and results derived from these games.

## About the Project
This project is based on fundamental concepts of *game theory* and *auction theory* to model strategic interactions among players. The goal is to understand how players maximize their payoffs under different auction formats while adhering to game rules.

The study emphasizes:
- Strategic decision-making in auctions.
- Behavioral shifts influenced by game rules and rewards.
- Practical applications of Nash equilibrium in auction scenarios.
